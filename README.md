This Python code implements a basic version of the classic game Tetris using the Pygame library. Here are the main capabilities of this code:

1. Tetris Game Logic:
It defines the game mechanics of Tetris, including piece movement, rotation, line clearing, and scoring.
Tetromino pieces fall from the top of the screen, and the player can move them horizontally, rotate them, or make them fall faster.
When a row is completely filled with Tetromino pieces, it gets cleared, and the player earns points based on the number of cleared lines.

2. Graphics and User Interface:
It utilizes Pygame to create a graphical interface for the game.
The game window has dimensions of 800x800 pixels.
It draws Tetromino pieces using colored rectangles on a grid-based playfield.
The current score is displayed on the screen during gameplay.
When the game ends (when pieces reach the top of the screen), a "Game Over" message is displayed.

3. Random Piece Generation:
It randomly generates Tetromino pieces with different shapes and colors.

4. Input Handling:
It handles user input from the keyboard to move, rotate, and drop Tetromino pieces.

4. Game Loop:
It maintains a game loop that continuously updates the game state, redraws the screen, and handles user input.

5. Scoring:
The game keeps track of the player's score, incrementing it when lines are cleared.

6. Restarting the Game:
After the game ends, the player can restart by pressing any key.

7. Adjustable Falling Speed:
The falling speed of Tetromino pieces can be adjusted by changing the fall_speed variable.

Overall, while this code provides a functional Tetris game, there's room for improvement and expansion, such as adding more features, enhancing the user interface, optimizing performance, and implementing additional game mechanics.
